# WhitespaceRemover

The goal of this script is to simply remove empty spaces at the end of a file and replace tabs at the beginning of a line by spaces.
You will need Ruby installed on your machine in order to make it work.

Usage: ruby whitespace_remover.rb path_to_file number_of_spaces_for_tabs

Enjoy !
